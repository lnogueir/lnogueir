                        With its main headquarter located in downtown Toronto, AGF is a company that provides software to facilitate the management of investments and assets for its clients.<br /> <br />
                        As a member of the IT Development Services, I played a key role on several projects under AGF.com's repository.
                        My most significant contributions were to the NIGO project, a project which implemented a messaging system between staff, dealers, investors and clients. I was able to experience the whole <b>development life cicle</b> of the project; from prototyping phase to production deployment.<br /><br />
                        Much of my work was done on an inbox page, which was the main component under development.
                        I was assigned a crucial task which came with big responsabilities â€” implement backend and frontend interface to handle the "reply message" routine. <br />
                        To complete such task I:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created endpoints to handle replied messages and perform communication between the web page and database.</li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented a <b>file scanning service</b> to ensure the security of BLOB uploads.<br />
                                <span className="pl15" style={{ opacity: .875 }}>
                                    <b>Note:</b> this was the <b>most challenging</b> task because as the user uploaded files, I had to transfer them to a virtual machine running an <b>ICAP server</b> with McAffe antivirus software, however, since ICAP protocol isn't as commonly used as HTTP, lack of documentation made it quite a challenge.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>Developed frontend interface prototype which had to be approved by the business and user experience team. Due to its success, I also implemented it into the project.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Besides the NIGO project, another essential project contribution I made was to migrate off a complex table of investments, currencies, government ratios and dates from <b>JSPs to ReactJs</b> components. To perform that, I had to update endpoints which used to return server built HTML to return <b>JSON</b> data that would be handled in the react application.
                        <br /><br />
                        Other than the above, daily basis I worked closely with developers and designers to create beautiful, responsive and dynamic web pages, utilized database tools to create/update <b>SQL stored procedures</b> and to vizualize data,  debugged and fixed other people's problems ðŸ˜‚.

                        The University Of Waterloo is ranked 20th in the world in Computer Science, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/computer-science?page=2">U.S. News</a>, and its Software Engineering program is the most competitive undergraduate program in Canada. <br /> <br />
                        As an ISA at UW's Computer Science department, I taught and coordinated <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs138/">CS138</a>, a 1st-year level Software Engineering course, and guaranteed its success with over <b>90%</b> of class approval at the end. <br /><br />
                        In order to promote the course's success, I had to perform both management and coding tasks.<br />
                        In terms of coding I:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conducted office hours and review sessions to teach students (who happened to be my age) topics such as Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming in the <b>C/C++</b> dialect.</li>
                            <li>Designed test cases and <b>Bash/Python</b> scripts which served the purpose of automatically generating assignments' grades. It functioned by compiling a solution and a student code then running it against a test case and after, outputting the results of the program to a text file. After that, it performs a "diff" command between the two different output files, this way determining whether the student passed such test case or not. Do that for every test case and every student and <b><i>voilÃ </i></b>; now you have graded the assignment of all students.</li>
                            <li>Made Excel/CSV scripts to automate adding/updating students' marks on the website.</li>
                            <li>Developed new features to the course website, which was used to post assignments and general information about the course. </li>
                        </ul>
                        Whereas in terms of management I:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assigned the contents and scheduled the rooms in which TAs would teach and conduct tutorials, respectively.</li>
                            <li>Coordinated marking scheme for exams and marked them alongside the professor and TAs.</li>
                            <li>Attended meetings with the Professors and TAs with weekly reports of course updates.</li>
                            <li>Managed as an instructor in online platforms such as a Piazza.</li>
                        </ul>
