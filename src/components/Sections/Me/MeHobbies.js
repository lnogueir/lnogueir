                        I've always tried to make sure my hobbies were something more than just fun to me. Hobbies for me should also be something productive, either socially or academically. 
                        A very good example of this are hackathons! Attending those couldn't be more fun and at the same time it is quite a learning experience. I can name several technologies (Google Vision, Speech-to-Text, many more...) that I've tried in these events and how those have improved my resume, specially when I was a beginner.

                        I started playing the guitar, at the age of 9 and up to this day this is one of my favorite hobbies. At this point, music is part of who I am.<br/>
                        I loved to play with other people and through music, I formed great friendships but most importantly developed important skills such as:

                        Ever since my exchange program, when I joined the track varsity team on my HS, running has been a passions and my favorite sport to practice. <br/> <br/>
                        I do not run competitively anymore, but I sure miss the feeling of being on a race! Now I run only 3-4 times a week as way to de-stress and as an excuse to listen to music for long periods of time üòÇ. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Running has kept me in shape and has contributed to my well-being mentally and physically in enumerous ways.
