                        I've always tried to make sure my hobbies were something more than just fun to me. For me, hobbies for me should also be something productive to you in some way. 
                        I found that attending hackathons are exactly that! Attending hackathons have been my #1 hobbie in the last few years. I have made many friends this way and experimented many technologies such as React Native, Google Vision and Speech-to-Text which improved my resume especially when I was in first year.

                        Another hobby of mine is playing the guitar. I started it when I was 9 and till this day I absolutely love it!
                        <br/>
                        Through music, I formed great friendships and most importantly developed important skills such as:

                    <ul style={{margin: '0 3px'}}>
                        <li>Getting out of my comfort zone: presenting in front of other people is TOUGH!</li>
                        <li>Teamwork: rehearsing and performing songs in a band is very challenging.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style={{margin: 0}}>
                        <br/>
                        Recently, I have been playing a lot of Guitar Hero! Checkout my <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperLucasGuns/videos">Youtube</a> channel for some low-quality guitar covers and guitar hero runs.

                        Another hobby that I love is running. I used to be part of the track team during High School and it's certainly my favorite sport to practice.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I do not run competitively anymore, but I sure miss the feeling of being on a race! Now I run only 3-4 times a week as way to de-stress and as an excuse to listen to music for long periods of time. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Running has kept me in shape and has contributed to my well-being mentally and physically in many ways.
