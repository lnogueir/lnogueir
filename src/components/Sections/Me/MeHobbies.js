                        I've always tried to make sure my hobbies were something more than just fun to me. For me, hobbies for me should also be something productive to you in some way. 
                        I found that attending hackathons are exactly that! Attending hackathons have been my #1 hobbie in the last few years. I have made many friends this way and experimented many technologies such as React Native, Google Vision and Speech-to-Text which improved my resume especially when I was in first year of school.

                        Playing the guitar is one of my absolute favorite things to do. I started playing it when I was 9, and, at this point, it is part of who I am.
                        <br/>
                        I loved to play with other people and through music, I formed great friendships and most importantly developed important skills such as:

                        <li>Learning under pressure when you need to master songs within tight deadlines</li>

                        Another hobby that I love is running. I used to be part of the track team during High School and it's certainly my favorite sport to practice.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I do not run competitively anymore, but I sure miss the feeling of being on a race! Now I run only 3-4 times a week as way to de-stress and as an excuse to listen to music for long periods of time üòÇ. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Running has kept me in shape and has contributed to my well-being mentally and physically in many ways.
