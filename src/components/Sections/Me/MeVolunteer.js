                        During high school, I did a lot of volunteering work. I found that a great way to socialize and develop my soft skills.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In my junior year, I enrolled in a public exchange program in the USA, and there I completed over 30 hours of volunteer work throughout the program in community centers, assisting elderly and setting up events.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Due to my many contributions, the exchange program agency awarded me with certificates and a trip to volunteer at their annual summer camp in Chicago to support little from the slums of the city!
