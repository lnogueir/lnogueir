                        I was born and raised in a city called Salvador, in the northeast of Brazil in the state of Bahia.<br />
                        Although I've been constantly moving since the age of 15, when I went on an Exchange Program, Salvador is and will always be my home town.
                        There is where all my childhood friends are and most importantly, my mom.<br /><br />
                        Most of my family, however, is from a city called Recife, also in the northeast of Brazil but in the state of Pernambuco.
                        I was lucky to have grown up in an awesome environment with lots of kids, playing several outdoor games and, of course, soccer on a daily basis. Surprisingly I completely lost interest in soccer and now I'm a basketball guy. I'm becoming Canadian ðŸ˜…!
