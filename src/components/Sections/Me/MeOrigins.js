                        I was born and raised in a city called Salvador, in the northeast of Brazil in the state of Bahia.<br /><br/>
                        Although I've been constantly moving since the age of 15, when I went on an Exchange Program, Salvador is and will always be my home town.
                        There is where all my childhood friends are and most importantly, my family.<br /><br />
                        I grew up playing outdoor games and soccer in the streets with lots of kids. Surprisingly, over the years I completely lost interest in soccer and now I'm a basketball guy.
