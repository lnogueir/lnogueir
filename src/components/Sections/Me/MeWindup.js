                        <br />
                        Throughout this journey, I have demonstrated to be a quick learner, a team worker and someone who's not afraid to face new challenges. <br />
                        Besides that, the amount of scenarios I've had to adapt have made me learn to be comfortable even when out of my comfort zone. <br />
                        However, none of that would have been possible if I haven't had great help and inspiration from family and friends.<br />
                        I am eternally grateful to all the people who have supported me, especially my mom, who plays a key role on the success I've had and the success that is yet to come. <br />

                    I was 10 years old which made me the youngest player in this concert.
