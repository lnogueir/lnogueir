                        <br />
                        High School was for me another life-changing experience.<br />
                        I moved to one of the best High Schools in Salvador I had math and sciences every year, and there I didn't know anybody. Thus, again, away from my friends.  <br />
                        As discussed above, I was overweight and a bit shy due to my sedentary hobbies. Therefore, initially, it was hard to adapt to the new environment. <br />
                        With that being said, I focused less on social interaction and more on academics. In my first year of HS, I quickly developed a passion for chemistry, achieved good marks and believed I was going to become a Chemical Engineer.
                        Once I learned about organic chemistry, all the chemistry between me and the subject had faded <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">üòÇ</span>. <br />
                        By the end of my first year, I enjoyed most of my courses especially physics, math and history and my hobbies were still very much active.

                        <br />
                        I ended the year weighing 85kg, which is a lot for a not very tall kid I was. Going to my second year of HS, I decided to change. I was determined to lose weight, stop playing video games and develop my social skills.<br />
                        At the same time, my mom motivated me to enroll in a public exchange program in the USA, which I would attend an american high school and live in the house of a traditional american family for 10 months.
                        As scary as that sounds, I took the challenge as I believed that would be the perfect opportunity to get out of my comfort zone, develop better social skill and properly learn english all at once. <br />
                        September 2015, I moved to a small town in upstate New York called Start Lake and there I completed my softmore year of High School. <br />
                        First challenge I faced was the language barrier. It was rough to understand those fast speaking countryside fellas. However, not knowing the language gave me an excuse in case I sound stupid <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">ü§£</span>, because of this fact, in my opinion, it was easier to socialize.

                        <br /><br />
                        After a month or so, the language was not a problem anymore. I was able to communicate well with everyone. Through volunteer work, I got in touch with a broad variety of people and backgrounds and this way my social skills rapidly increased. <br /><br />
                        Surprisingly, the language didn't affect my marks either. Against the exchange student coordinator's advice, I took physics with the Seniors, chemistry with the Juniors and math with the Softmores. <br />
                        To be honest, it was a lot easier than my school in Brazil, as for me. Since for me, the content covered was mostly a review, except for a couple of topics in physics, due to this, without too much effort, I managed to be on the honor roll list in the school every single month of the program. <br />
                        I was quite happy with the way the exchange program was going since most goals I had set had been accomplished, but one was left.

                        I still had planned to lose weight and become fit. Without excuses, I went chasing it. <br />
                        A bit before winter 2016, I went to the gym every day with my host siblings and friends. It was a great way to socialize while doing something productive under the cold weather of NY. By the time of spring, I had lost over 40 pounds. <br />
                        This way, I was able to join the varsity track team and compete alongside my host brother. <br />
                        Our coach was an AMAZING guy. He was a retired navy and previously a rugby athlete. Our everyday practices were tiring and tough. As a reference, the team started with 15 people and ended with 6. I enjoyed the hustle, the coach inspired me and made me want to impress him. Under his guidance I managed to put on 22 pounds back, but now of lean muscle.<br />
                        After that, I had accomplished all the goals I had set in mind when I decided to go to my exchange program.

                        <br />
                        With a month left till the completion of the program, due to my volunteer work awards and academic achievements I received an invitation from GreenHeart, the non-profit organization that offered the exchange program, to spend a couple more weeks in the USA to become a camp leader at their annual camp aimed towards poor children in Chicago. <br />
                        Of course, I accepted such a great offer. They made me a tourist and introduced me to the beautiful city of Chicago. <br />
                        After that, at the camp, I had daily tasks with the dorm I was managing. <br />
                        I had to come up with a battle cry, dorm symbol and organize outdoor games. The kids came up with a dorm lullaby and I played the guitar along with them. <br />
                        In the end, I was assigned to perform a presentation about my culture and life in Brazil to the children from all dorms. <br />
                        This experience exposed me closer to the reality of children from the suburbs of a big city in America, it was very fulfilling to work with these kids, but at the same time sad and emotional to see them crying at the of the camp.

                        After a year full of new achievements, I came back to Brazil. And now, I was certain that I wanted to live abroad. Luckily, my mom's brother, who happens to be a software developer, had moved to Canada a couple of years back and told me very good things about the University Of Waterloo. Thus, at 16 years of age, I had set a new goal: attend UWaterloo Engineering. <br />
                        In the meantime though, I had to catch up on my school, since the year I spent abroad had been academically lighter. Since my goal was on UWaterloo and not the local schools, I focused on achieving good scores on international exams such as the IELTS and SAT, for instance. However, knowing how competitive it would be to get in waterloo, I needed a second option in case waterloo didn't work out, hence I also studied for the ENEM (the Brazilian national exam for entrance to most universities). <br />
                        I focused mostly on math, physics, and essay (ENEM's essay is worth a LOT). For math and physics, I spent several extra hours with the teachers on a daily basis. And in order to practice essays, I did something rather unusual: I read books nonstop. In 2017, I read over 20 books (mostly related to current events, politics, and history) while maintaining an over 90% average in school and committed to the gym every day.  <br />

                    <p>
                        <br />
                        At that point, I had decided which engineering to pursue: Electrical. I had chosen it due to my passion for math and physics. Such passion would later turn fully into programming.
                        By the end of the year, I had good enough marks on all the necessary international exams required for UW, however, I wouldn't know whether I got accepted or not until March. However, due to geographic reasons, universities in Brazil start in February. <br />
                        After receiving results from the ENEM, I was eligible to attend one of Brazil's most prestigious engineering institutes, UFRJ (Federal University Of Rio de Janeiro). <br />
                        As that had been always my second option, I moved to Rio de Janeiro at the beginning of 2018 to study Electrical Engineering. <br />
                        That will begin my transition into adulthood, which will be discussed with more details next.
