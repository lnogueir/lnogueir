                    Hi!<br />
                    Welcome to my home on the internet. <br />
                    As you've guessed, my name is Lucas, more specifically Lucas Nogueira Serafim de Araujo. I know, it's huge. <br />
                    I am 19 years old and I currently pursue a Computer Engineering degree at the University Of Waterloo with hopes to graduate in 2023. <br /><br />
                    This section, unlike the others, it's not focused on my work/academic related accomplishments. It's about Lucas' story; a story of someone who's curious and eager to learn something new everyday.<br /><br />
                    It is a way for me to reflect and remember the things I have done in a nice synthesized chronological order.
