                    Hi and welcome to my home on the internet!<br />
                    As you've guessed, my name is Lucas, more specifically Lucas Nogueira Serafim de Araujo. I know, it's huge. <br />
                    I am 20 years old and I currently pursue a Computer Engineering degree at the University Of Waterloo with hopes to graduate in 2023. <br /><br />
                    This section, unlike the others, it's not focused on my work/academic related accomplishments. It's for you to get to know me better and learn about my interests and what I do for fun! Hopefully you can relate to me in some way ðŸ˜ƒ.<br /><br />
                    Make sure to connect with me on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className="link" href="https://github.com/lnogueir">Github</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className="link" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/lucas-nogueira-2b1b58190">Linkedin</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/lucasnogueira021/">Instagram</a>!
